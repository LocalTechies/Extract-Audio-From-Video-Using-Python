Extracting audio from video using "moviepy"

Steps involved in extracting audio from video using python is as follows:
1. Install moviepy package using pip/conda.
2. In an IDE import the installed package moviepy, for editing moviepy provides a default editor calss. import moviepy.editor for using the editor.
3. Call the method "VideoFileClip()" to import video to the editor of moviepy
4. After exctracting audio from the video save the file, for doing that we have a function write_audiofile().

Make sure you have an internet connected while executing the file, as moviepy uses net for extraction of audio.
